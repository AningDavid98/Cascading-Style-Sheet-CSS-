    <p>Dear <span class="blurred">Agent S'more</span>,

We have an emergency. The secret formula for our Mega Marshmallow has been compromised. This formula is what makes our marshmallows the fluffiest and most delicious.</p>

<p>We suspect that <span class="blurred">Professor Puff</span> is behind this. He has taken the formula to his hidden laboratory. Your mission is to infiltrate the lab and secure the formula before it's too late.</p>

<p>Be sure to keep the lab's location confidential. <span class="blurred">Any leak of this information</span> could jeopardize the entire operation.</p>
    <div id="top-secret">TOP SECRET</div>
